aws_init

Purpose: For automatically starting an AWS instance and, optionally, running a
command in a screen on the instance

Starting a server:
$ cd aws_init
$ python
>>> import startami
>>> image = 'ubuntu1004x64'
>>> instancetype = 'm1.large'
>>> accesskey = 'blahblahblahmyaccesskey'
>>> secretkey = 'blahblahblahmysecretkey'
>>> pkname = 'thenameofmyprivatekey'
>>> 
>>> startami.startami(image, instancetype, accesskey, secretkey, pkname)

This will only start up the instance and return a (username, DNSname) tuple for
remote access to the server.

Starting a server and run a command:
$ cd aws_init
$ python
>>> import startami
>>> image = 'ubuntu1004x64'
>>> instancetype = 'm1.large'
>>> accesskey = 'blahblahblahmyaccesskey'
>>> secretkey = 'blahblahblahmysecretkey'
>>> pkname = 'thenameofmyprivatekey'
>>> command = 'sleep 240'
>>> 
>>> startami.startAndRun(image, instancetype, accesskey, secretkey,
... pkname, command)

This will start an instance and run the command as root in a detached screen.
A (username, DNSname) tuple for remote access is returned.
