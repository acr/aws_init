aws_init

Purpose: For automatically starting and configuring AWS instances, using
chef-solo to install arbitrary software packages.

Simple use case:
$ cd aws_init
>>> import startami
>>> image = 'ubuntu1004x64'
>>> instancetype = 'm1.large'
>>> accesskey = 'blahblahblahmyaccesskey'
>>> secretkey = 'blahblahblahmysecretkey'
>>> pkname = 'thenameofmyprivatekey'
>>> softwareList = ['zsh', 'screen', 'git']
>>>
>>> startami.prepareInstance(image, instancetype, accesskey, secretkey,
... pkname, softwareList)

after keeping your fingers crossed and waiting an absurdly long time, the
method should report back the ('username', 'dnsname') of the server that you
can use to log into. The software you listed will be automatically installed.
